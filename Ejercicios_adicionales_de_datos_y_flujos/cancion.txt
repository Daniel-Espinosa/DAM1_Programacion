Living easy, living free 
Season ticket on a one-way ride 
Asking nothing, leave me be 
Taking everything in my stride 
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme 
Ain't nothing 
I would rather do 
Going down, party time 
My friends are going to be there too
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
No stop signs, speed limit 
Nobody's going to slow me down 
Like a wheel, going to spin it 
Nobody's going to mess me around 
Hey Satan, payed my dues 
Playing in a rocking band 
Hey Momma, just look at me 
I'm on my way to the promised land
I'm on the highway to hell 
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
Don't stop me
I'm on the highway to hell 
On the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
And I'm going down, all the way down 
I'm on the highway to hell
